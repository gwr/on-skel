# uts/common/Makefile.rules
#
#	This Makefile defines all the file build rules for the directory
# uts/common and its children. These are the source files which may
# be considered common to all SunOS systems.
#
#	The following two-level ordering must be maintained in this file.
#	  Lines are sorted first in order of decreasing specificity based on
#	  the first directory component.  That is, sun4u rules come before
#	  sparc rules come before common rules.
#
#	  Lines whose initial directory components are equal are sorted
#	  alphabetically by the remaining components.

#
#	Section 1a: C objects build rules
#

#	Section 1b:	Lint `objects'
